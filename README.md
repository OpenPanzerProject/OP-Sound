# Open Panzer Sound Card
The Open Panzer Soudn Card is a work in progress with the goal of bringing inexpensive, high quality, and open source sound functionality to RC models but especially to tanks. The board is actually made up of two components. First, a [PJRC Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html) is used as the onboard processor. Secondly, a carrier board that adds an SD card slot (max 32 GB), an additional 16 MB of flash memory, an [LM48310](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/LM48310SD-NOPB/LM48310SD-NOPBCT-ND/1765468) 2.6 watt audio amplifier, and headers for exernal connections. 

A discussion thread on the development of this card can be found on the [Open Panzer Forums](http://openpanzer.org/forum/index.php?topic=17.0).
